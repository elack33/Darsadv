This is my old website, done after an XHTML class at CNMCC around 2009.
Since facebook became so easy to use to organize pictures and my adventures, I stopped renewing the website but kept a copy of it because I did learn alot about CSS and HTML when I made it. 
I put it here to remember what I've done and to show my improvement when I update my knowledge of web development.
